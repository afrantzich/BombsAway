This project was done as prep work to help mentor a summer coding camp for high school students.
It uses a program called Processing, a download can be found here: https://processing.org/download/

This is a very simple game influenced by the classic Missile Command.

Hold mouse click to pop falling bombs, bombs get faster each time they are destroyed,
press spacebar to use 'power', slowing down the bombs to their original speed.

Score is dependant upon the speed of the bomb that is destroyed.

Difficulty setting could be easily implemented by changing # of bombs and/or starting speed.
Start menu or replay option at score screen would be a nice touch.

Enjoy!
